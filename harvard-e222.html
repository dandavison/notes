<p><strong> 2.2.1 </strong></p>
<p><strong> 2.2.14 (122) Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be a cyclic group of order <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, and let <span class="math">\(r\)</span> be an integer
dividing <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math">\(G\)</span> contains exactly one subgroup of order <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. </strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is prime then the only subgroups of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\{e\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. The
integers which divide <span class="math">\(n\)</span> are 1 and <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and so it is true that for every such
integer <span class="math">\(r\)</span> there is one subgroup of order <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is not prime then <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has non-trivial subgroups for every integer that
divides it.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has order 8, the claim is that <span class="math">\(G\)</span> has only one subgroup of
order 2. Well, all subgroups of order 2 are isomorphic to <span class="math">\(\{e, \tau\}\)</span>. So the
claim implies that groups of permutations of order 4, 6, 8 etc (i.e. <span class="math">\(S_4, S_6,
S_8\)</span>) contain only one transposition.</p>
<p>A solution is given in the
<a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/class/harvard/122/02/html/home/solns/hw2.pdf">Harvard 122 materials</a>.</p>
<p>The starting point is to note that <span class="math">\(&lt;g^{n/r}&gt;\)</span> is a subgroup of order <span class="math">\(r\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(n/r\)</span> fits <span class="math">\(r\)</span> times into each chunk of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> items). So in the example with <span class="math">\(G\)</span>
of order 8, <span class="math">\(&lt;g^{4}&gt;\)</span> has order 2. The question is whether there is any other
subgroup of order 2. Intuitively it seems obvious that the answer is no, since
only 4 divides up chunks of 8 in that way.</p>
<p>Formally, the proof proceeds by supposing that <span class="math">\(H' = &lt;g^m&gt;\)</span> also has order <span class="math">\(r\)</span>
(using a lemma that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic). It then shows
that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> must divide <span class="math">\(n\)</span> (otherwise leads to a contradiction). Therefore the
order of <span class="math">\(H'\)</span> is <span class="math">\(n/m\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(m = n/r\)</span> which shows that <span class="math">\(H'\)</span> is <span class="math">\(H\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong> 1. Read Artin 1.4.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 2. Let <span class="math">\(V\)</span> denote the Klein 4-group. Show that Aut(<span class="math">\(V\)</span>) is isomorphic to <span class="math">\(S_3\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Every automorphism sends the identity to itself. This is because an
automorphism must preserve structure, therefore we require <span class="math">\(\rho(e) =
\rho(ee^\1) = \rho(e)\rho(e^\1) = \rho(e)\rho(e)^\1\)</span> which implies <span class="math">\(\rho(e) =
e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, elements of Aut(<span class="math">\(V\)</span>) are distinguished by their effect on the 3
non-identity elements and there is a 1-1 correspondence <span class="math">\(f\)</span> between elements of
Aut(<span class="math">\(V\)</span>) and <span class="math">\(S_3\)</span>.</p>
<p>We need to show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a homomorphism, i.e. that <span class="math">\(f(\rho_1 \rho_2) =
f(\rho_1) f(\rho_2)\)</span>. The operation is composition of permutations in both
groups...the identity seems obvious.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>Define <span class="math">\(f : \GL_n(\R) \rightarrow \GL_n(\R)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(f(A) =~ ^tA^\1\)</span> (where <span class="math">\(^tA\)</span>
is the transpose of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>). Show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is an automorphism, but not an inner
automorphism for <span class="math">\(n ≥ 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is an automorphism we need to show that it preserves structure
and is a bijection.</p>
<p><em>Preservation of structure:</em> We require that <span class="math">\(^t(AB)^\1 =~ ^tA^\1~ ^tB^\1\)</span>.
The RHS is <span class="math">\(^tA^\1~ ^tB^\1 = (^tB^tA)^\1 = ~^t(AB)^\1\)</span> as required.</p>
<p><em>Bijection:</em> <span class="math">\(f^\1(A) =~ ^tA\)</span>. Since an inverse mapping exists, the original
mapping must be bijective.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to show that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not an inner automorphism for <span class="math">\(n \geq
1\)</span>. An inner automorphism is an automorphism defined by <span class="math">\(\rho(A) = BAB^\1\)</span> for
some fixed <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. So we need to show that there is no <span class="math">\(B\)</span> for which <span class="math">\(^tA^\1 =
BAB^\1\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math">\(BAB^\1\)</span> corresponds to the action of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> performed in a
basis defined by <span class="math">\(B\)</span>. The determinant of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is invariant under change of
basis. However, <span class="math">\(\det ~^tA^\1 = (\det A)^\1\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(^tA^\1 = BAB^\1\)</span> is
not true in general since it is not true when <span class="math">\(\det A \neq \pm 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/98378/fx-tx-1-is-an-automorphism-of-gl-n-mathbbr</p>
<p>I'm also watching these lectures and trying to do the homework, so by no means
an expert. In the final part of the proof, a variant would be to use
determinants:</p>
<p>Assume that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is an inner automorphism. Therefore for some fixed <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, <span class="math">\(^tA^\1
= BAB^\1\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. But this implies <span class="math">\((\det A)^\1 = \det A\)</span> which is true
only for <span class="math">\(\det A = \pm 1\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is not an inner automorphism.</p>
<p><strong>4. 1.4.5 Prove that the transpose of a permutation matrix P is its inverse.</strong></p>
<h3 id="e122-homework-5">E122 Homework 5</h3>
<hr />
<p><strong>2.5.1 Prove that the nonempty fibres of a map form a partition of the domain.</strong></p>
<p>We need to show</p>
<ol>
<li>That every element of the domain is in some fibre, and</li>
<li>That no element is in more than one fibre</li>
</ol>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(f\)</span> be a map from set <span class="math">\(S\)</span> to set <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. A fibre <span class="math">\(\phi_t\)</span> of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is the set
<span class="math">\(\{s: f(s) = t\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For any element <span class="math">\(s\)</span> in the domain, <span class="math">\(f(s)\)</span> exists and <span class="math">\(s\)</span> is in fibre
<span class="math">\(\phi_{f(s)}\)</span>. This proves (1).</p>
<p>To prove (2), suppose that <span class="math">\(s\)</span> belongs to fibres <span class="math">\(\phi_{t_1}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\phi_{t_2}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(f(s) = t_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f(s) = t_2\)</span> which is a contradiction
showing that no element belongs to two fibres.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2.5.6</strong></p>
<p><strong>(a) Prove that the relation <span class="math">\(x\)</span> conjugate to <span class="math">\(y\)</span> in a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is an
  equivalence relation on <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p><span class="math">\(x\)</span> conjugate to <span class="math">\(y\)</span> means <span class="math">\(y = gxg^{-1}\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(g \in G\)</span>. We need to show
that the relation is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.</p>
<p><em>Reflexivity</em>: <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is equal to <span class="math">\(x\)</span> conjugated with the identity element: <span class="math">\(x = exe^{-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Symmetry</em>: Let <span class="math">\(y = gxg^{-1}\)</span>. Then multiplying on the right by <span class="math">\(g\)</span> and on the
            left by <span class="math">\(g^{-1}\)</span> gives <span class="math">\(g^{-1}yg = x\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>Transitivity</em>: Let <span class="math">\(y = g_1xg_1^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(z = g_2yg_2^{-1}\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(z =
                g_2(g_1xg_1^{-1})g_2^{-1} = (g_2g_1)x(g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1})\)</span></p>
<p><strong>(b) Describe the elements <span class="math">\(a\)</span> whose conjugacy class (= equivalence class)
consists of the element <span class="math">\(a\)</span> alone.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2.6.2 Prove directly that distinct cosets do not overlap.</strong></p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(H\)</span> be a subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and let <span class="math">\(g_1H = \{g_1h:h\in H\}\)</span> be a coset of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>
in <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. Consider an element <span class="math">\(g_3 \in g_1H\)</span>. This means that <span class="math">\(g_3 = g_1h\)</span> for a
unique <span class="math">\(h \in H\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math">\(g_3\)</span> is also in another coset <span class="math">\(g_2H\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(g_3 = g_1h = g_2h'\)</span>
for <span class="math">\(h, h' \in H\)</span> and therefore <span class="math">\(g_1hh'^{-1} = g_2\)</span>. But <span class="math">\(hh'^{-1} \in H\)</span> so
<span class="math">\(g_2\)</span> is in coset <span class="math">\(g_1H\)</span>, which shows that cosets <span class="math">\(g_1H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(g_2H\)</span> are the
same.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>2.6.4 Give an example showing that left cosets and right cosets of <span class="math">\(\GL_2(\R)\)</span>
  in <span class="math">\(\GL_2(\C)\)</span> are not always equal.</strong></p>
<p>We don't even need to consider matrices outside <span class="math">\(\GL_2(\R)\)</span>. Let A =
<span class="math">\(\smat{1}{0}
      {0}{0}\)</span> and let <span class="math">\(H = \GL_2(\R)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Geometrically, this matrix projects points in 2D onto the x-axis.</p>
<p>The left coset of <span class="math">\(\GL_2(\R)\)</span> containing <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the set of matrices of the form</p>
<div class="math">$$
\smat{1}{0}
     {0}{0} \smat{a}{b}
                 {c}{d} = \smat{a}{b}
                               {0}{0}
$$</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(a,b,c,d \in \R\)</span>. Geometrically, this composition first sends the basis
vectors to new locations with x-coordinates <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, and then projects onto
the x axis.</p>
<p>The right coset of <span class="math">\(\GL_2(\R)\)</span> containing <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is the set of matrices of the form</p>
<div class="math">$$
\smat{a}{b}
     {c}{d} \smat{1}{0}
                 {0}{0} = \smat{a}{0}
                               {c}{0}
$$</div>
<p>Geometrically, this composition first sends the <span class="math">\(\scvec{0}{1}\)</span> basis vector to
the origin, and then performs an arbitrary linear transformation. But once sent
to the origin, the <span class="math">\(\scvec{0}{1}\)</span> basis vector stays there, regardless of the
nature of the second transformation.</p>

<p><strong>2.6.5 Let <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> be subgroups of a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> of orders 3, 5
  respectively. Prove that <span class="math">\(H \cap K = \{e\}\)</span>.</strong></p>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(K\)</span> are of prime order, they are isomorphic to the cyclic groups
of orders 3 and 5 respectively. Therefore the non-identity elements of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> are
of order 3, and the non-identity elements of <span class="math">\(K\)</span> are of order 5 (because the
order of an element in a group must divide the order of the group). Therefore,
while <span class="math">\(e\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(H \cap K\)</span>, no other element is.</p>

<p><strong> 2.9.2 2. </strong></p>
<p><strong> (a) Prove that the square <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> of an integer <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4. </strong></p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is even, so <span class="math">\(a = 2n\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n \in \Z\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(a^2 = 4n^2 \equiv
0\)</span> (mod 4). Alternatively, suppose <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is odd, i.e. <span class="math">\(a = 2n + 1\)</span> for some <span class="math">\(n
\in \Z\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(a^2 = 4n^2 + 4n +1 \equiv 1\)</span> (mod 4).</p>
<p><strong> (b) What are the possible values of <span class="math">\(a^2\)</span> modulo 8? </strong></p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is even, then <span class="math">\(a^2 = 4n^2\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(n^2\)</span> is odd then <span class="math">\(a^2 \equiv 4\)</span> (mod 8)
and if even then <span class="math">\(a^2 \equiv 0\)</span> (mod 8). If <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math">\(a^2 = 4n(n+1) + 1
\equiv 1\)</span> (mod 8). So the possible values are 0, 1, 4.</p>

<p><strong> 2.9.4 Prove that every integer a is congruent to the sum of its decimal
digits modulo 9. </strong></p>

Note that <span class="math">\(10 \equiv 1\)</span> (mod 9). So <span class="math">\(a \equiv d_0 + d_1 + d_2 + \ldots\)</span> (mod 9).</p>
<p><em>My solution</em>: we require that the difference is a multiple of 9. The difference
is <span class="math">\(\sum_{i=0}^\infty d_i 10^i - \sum_{i=0}^\infty d_i = \sum_{i=0}^\infty

<span class="math">\(x = 2^\1 5 \equiv 5 \cdot 5 \equiv 7\)</span> (mod 9)</p>
<p>The possible values of <span class="math">\(2x\)</span> (mod 9) are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So 2 (mod
9) does have a multiplicative inverse (5).</p>
<p><em>My solution</em>: <span class="math">\(14 = 2 \cdot 7 \equiv 5\)</span> (mod 9). So the solution is <span class="math">\(x \equiv 7\)</span> (mod 9).</p>

The possible values of <span class="math">\(2x\)</span> (mod 6) are 0, 2, 4. Therefore <span class="math">\(2x \equiv 5\)</span> has no

<p>I.e. 2 (mod 6) has no multiplicative inverse?</p>
<p><em>My solution</em>: <span class="math">\(\bar 5\)</span> (mod 6) <span class="math">\(= 5 + 6\Z = 1 + 2\cdot2 + 2\cdot3\Z = 1 + 2(2 + 3\Z)\)</span> is an

<p><span class="math">\(1 \equiv an + bm\)</span> (mod <span class="math">\(m\)</span>) <span class="math">\(\rightarrow 1 \equiv an\)</span> (mod <span class="math">\(m\)</span>).</p>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(\gcd(n, m) = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math">\(n^{-1} \equiv a \mod m\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math">\(m^{-1}
\equiv b \mod n\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p>My attempt:</p>
<p>We need to show that for any values <span class="math">\(a,b\)</span>, we can always find an integer <span class="math">\(x\)</span>
which exceeds the previous multiple of <span class="math">\(m\)</span> by <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and exceeds the previous
multiple of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> by <span class="math">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we want to show that the intersection of <span class="math">\(a + m\Z\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b + n\Z\)</span> is
non-empty. I.e. we need to show that we can always find integers <span class="math">\(r, s\)</span>
satisfying <span class="math">\(a + rm = b +sn\)</span>. That's equivalent to <span class="math">\(rm - sn = b - a\)</span>. We know
that <span class="math">\(m\Z + n\Z = \gcd(m, n)\Z\)</span>, and thus since <span class="math">\(\gcd(m, n) = 1\)</span> we know that
<span class="math">\(m\Z + n\Z\)</span> is all of <span class="math">\(\Z\)</span>. Therefore the integer <span class="math">\(b - a\)</span> must be reachable by
taking some number <span class="math">\(b\)</span> of steps of length <span class="math">\(m\)</span> and some number <span class="math">\(-a\)</span> of steps of
length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong> 2.10.1 (E122 &amp; 122) Let <span class="math">\(G\)</span> be the group of invertible real upper triangular
2 x 2 matrices. Determine whether or not the following conditions describe

<p>This is closed, contains the identity and contains inverses, so it is a
subgroup. And closed under conjugation, so normal.</p>
<p>Geometrically, the elements of the subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> are matrices representing a
stretch in the direction of the second basis vector ("Y axis") and shearing
parallel to the first basis vector ("X axis). Conjugation yields matrices
<span class="math">\(ghg^\1\)</span> which correspond to doing the same transformation in a different
basis. However, this class of change-of-basis operations preserves the
direction of the first basis vector. Therefore the transformation, in the new
basis, also corresponds to stretching in the direction of the second basis
vector and shearing parallel to the first basis vector, and thus the conjugated
matrix is still in the subgroup.</p>

$$</div>
<p>The theory of quotient groups involves identifying establishing a group
structure on a set of cosets of a normal subgroup: this set of cosets is then a
quotient group <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span>. There's a homomorphism <span class="math">\(f:G \rightarrow G/H\)</span> defined by
<span class="math">\(f(g) =\)</span> (coset containing <span class="math">\(g\)</span>), and the multiplication law between cosets is</p>
<p>(coset containing <span class="math">\(g\)</span>) x (coset containing <span class="math">\(g'\)</span>) = (coset containing <span class="math">\(gg'\)</span>)</p>
<p>The normal subgroup is the kernel of this homomorphism, since <span class="math">\(f(1)\)</span> = (coset
containing <span class="math">\(1\)</span>) = <span class="math">\(1H\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we have a subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> of the group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> of real upper-triangular 2x2
matrices.  We've determined that the normal subgroup is <span class="math">\(H\)</span>, a particular
subset of real upper-triangular matrices. Each coset is therefore, for some
fixed <span class="math">\(g \in G\)</span>, the set of matrices that can be obtained by multiplying <span class="math">\(g\)</span> by
some <span class="math">\(h \in H\)</span>. So there are infinitely many cosets and each has infinitely
many elements. Each coset contains matrices of the form</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
\mat{1}{b}
    {0}{d} \mat{e}{f}
               {0}{h} = \mat{e}{b + df}
                            {0}{dh    }.
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p>Since <span class="math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math">\(d\)</span> can be any real numbers, we could write this as</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{align*}
\mat{1}{*}
    {0}{*} \mat{a}{b}

                            {0}{*},
\end{align*}
$$</div>
<p>thus the cosets are distinguished by the real number in their top-left
entry. So the quotient group <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> is <span class="math">\(\left\{\smat{a}{*} {0}{*}: a \in
\R\right\}\)</span>; it is isomorphic to the positive real numbers (elements of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>
would not be invertible if <span class="math">\(a\)</span> were <span class="math">\(0\)</span>). Viewed as transformations of the

stretch in the x-direction.</p>

again, it is not closed under conjugation, so not normal.</p>
<p>Geometrically, the matrix represents a stretch in orthogonal x- and
y-directions. The non-normality is because the matrix that performs the
transformation in the changed basis does not stretch in the directions of the
basis vectors in the original basis.</p>

<p>Closed and contains identity and inverses, so a subgroup, but again not closed

<p>Geometrically, the matrix represents a stretch by the same amount in orthogonal

<p><strong> 2.10.3 Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> be a partition of a group <span class="math">\(G\)</span> with the property that for any
pair of elements <span class="math">\(A, B\)</span> of the partition, the product set <span class="math">\(AB\)</span> is contained
entirely within another element <span class="math">\(C\)</span> of the partition. Let <span class="math">\(N\)</span> be the element of
<span class="math">\(P\)</span> which contains 1. Prove that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is a normal subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> and that <span class="math">\(P\)</span>
is the set of its cosets. </strong></p>
<p><strong> Prove that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is a normal subgroup of <span class="math">\(G\)</span>: </strong></p>
<p>We know that <span class="math">\(1 = 1^\1\)</span> is in <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Therefore we know that the product set <span class="math">\(NN\)</span>
must lie entirely within <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, since one example of a product
(i.e. <span class="math">\(1\cdot1^\1\)</span>) is in <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. I.e. <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is closed. Does it contain inverses?
Consider an arbitrary element <span class="math">\(n\)</span> of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(n^\1\)</span> be in some element <span class="math">\(A \in
P\)</span> of the partition. Then the product set <span class="math">\(NA\)</span> must lie entirely within <span class="math">\(N\)</span>,
since <span class="math">\(nn^\1\)</span> does. So either <span class="math">\(A = N\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> are distinct elements of
the partition but with the property that <span class="math">\(NN = NA\)</span>. I'm going to say that <span class="math">\(NN =
NA\)</span> implies <span class="math">\(N = A\)</span> by the definition of the problem, and thus that <span class="math">\(N\)</span>
contains inverses, but I may be missing something here.</p>
<p>So, <span class="math">\(N\)</span> contains the identity, is closed and contains inverses. It inherits
associativity from <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is a subgroup. Is it normal? Consider <span class="math">\(gNg^\1\)</span>
for some fixed <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(1 \in N\)</span>, we conclude that <span class="math">\(gN\)</span> is a subset of the
element <span class="math">\(A\)</span> of the partition that contains <span class="math">\(g\)</span>. And since <span class="math">\(g \in gN\)</span>,
<span class="math">\((gN)g^\1\)</span> must be a subset of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is normal.</p>
<p><strong> Prove that <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is the set of its cosets: </strong></p>
<p>The set of cosets of <span class="math">\(N\)</span> are <span class="math">\(\{gN: g \in G\}\)</span> by definition.</p>
<p>We need to show that exactly one partition satisfying the definition of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>
exists, and that it is the set of cosets of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, we show that the set of cosets satisfy the definition of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. Consider
two cosets <span class="math">\(gN\)</span> and <span class="math">\(hN\)</span>. Their product set is <span class="math">\((gN)(hN)\)</span>. We know that <span class="math">\(g \in
gN\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h \in hN\)</span> so we conclude that <span class="math">\((gN)(hN)\)</span> is a subset of the element of
the partition that contains <span class="math">\(gh\)</span>.</p>
<p>So the set of cosets satisfy the definition of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, showing that at least one
such partition exists. Now we show that any such partition must be the set of
cosets. Consider subsets <span class="math">\(A, B\)</span> of <span class="math">\(G\)</span> that satisfy the definition of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. We
need to show that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are cosets of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>. Fix an arbitrary element <span class="math">\(a\)</span>
of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(1 \in N\)</span> and <span class="math">\(a1 \in A\)</span> we conclude that the product set <span class="math">\(AN\)</span> is
equal to <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and therefore that <span class="math">\(A\)</span> is equal to the coset <span class="math">\(aN\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math">\(B\)</span>
is a coset of <span class="math">\(N\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong> 2.10.5 Identify the quotient group <span class="math">\(\R^\times/P\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(P\)</span> denotes the subgroup of
positive real numbers. </strong></p>
<p>The cosets of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> are the positive and negative reals, <span class="math">\(\{P, -1P\}\)</span>. We define
composition of cosets to be <span class="math">\((xP)(yP) = (xy)P\)</span>. The group operation is
commutative, therefore <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is normal and the operation on cosets is
well-defined. Therefore the quotient group is isomorphic to the group of size
2: <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is the identity and <span class="math">\((-1P)(-1P) = P\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> 2.10.6 Let <span class="math">\(H = \{±1, ±i\}\)</span> be the subgroup of <span class="math">\(G = \Cx\)</span> of fourth roots
of unity. Describe the cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> explicitly, and prove that <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> is
isomorphic to <span class="math">\(G\)</span>. </strong></p>
<p>The cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span> in <span class="math">\(G\)</span> are sets of the form <span class="math">\(zH = \{±z, ±zi\}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(z \in
\Cx\)</span>. Geometrically, they are the four points of a cross in the complex
plane; a rotated and scaled version of the unit cross corresponding to <span class="math">\(\{±1,
±i\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math">\(z \neq z'\)</span> then <span class="math">\(zH \neq z'H\)</span>. So there is a bijection between <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(G\)</span>. I.e. <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong> 2.10.10 (122) Describe the quotient groups <span class="math">\(\Cx / P\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Cx /

denotes the positive reals. </strong></p>
<p><strong> <span class="math">\(\Cx / P\)</span> </strong></p>
<p>The cosets of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> are the set of radial lines emanating from the origin in the
complex plane. So a single coset is <span class="math">\(e^{i\theta}P = \{pe^{i\theta} | p \in P\}\)</span>
and there is one coset for every value of <span class="math">\(\theta \in [0, 2\pi)\)</span>. We define the
following operation on the set of cosets:
<span class="math">\((e^{i\theta_1}P)(e^{i\theta_2}P) = e^{i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}P\)</span>. The group operation is commutative, therefore <span class="math">\(P\)</span> is normal and the operation is well-defined.</p>
<p>So the quotient group is isomorphic to the group of angles <span class="math">\([0, 2\pi)\)</span> under addition, and to <span class="math">\(U\)</span>. This is the "circle group" <span class="math">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong> <span class="math">\(\Cx / U\)</span> </strong></p>
<p>The cosets of <span class="math">\(U\)</span> are concentric circles in the complex plane. So a single coset is <span class="math">\(re^{i\phi}U = rU = \{re^{i\theta}|0\leq\theta&lt;2\pi\}\)</span>, and there is one coset for every <span class="math">\(r \in P\)</span>. We define the
following operation on the set of cosets: <span class="math">\((r_1U)(r_2U) = r_1r_2U\)</span>. The group operation is commutative, therefore <span class="math">\(U\)</span> is normal and the operation is well-defined.</p>
