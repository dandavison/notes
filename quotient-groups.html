<h3 id="modular-arithmetic">Modular arithmetic</h3>
<p>The canonical example of a quotient group comes from "modular arithmetic" on
the integers. For example, consider the integers, mod 4. This means that every
integer is mapped to whatever its remainder is after dividing by 4. The
integers mod 4 is a group, which contains 4 elements: <span class="math">\(\{\bar 0, \bar 1, \bar
2, \bar 3\}\)</span>. So <span class="math">\(5 \rightarrow \bar 1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(14 \rightarrow \bar 2\)</span>, <span class="math">\(-1
\rightarrow \bar 3\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p>We said that the integers mod 4 are a group, so what is the group operation?
The answer is that we define an addition law on the elements: for example,
<span class="math">\(\bar 1 + \bar 3 = \bar{1 + 3} = \bar 4 = \bar 0\)</span>. In words, to find the result
of combining <span class="math">\(\bar 1\)</span> with <span class="math">\(\bar 3\)</span>, you first add <span class="math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(3\)</span> as usual to get
4, then see where <span class="math">\(4\)</span> is mapped to, and that's the answer. This corresponds to
the fairly familiar notion that e.g. <span class="math">\(5 + 23 = 28 = 0\)</span> (mod 4), but it is a bit
subtle/slippery, and it helps to pause and consider exactly what's going on.</p>
<p>Let's be explicit about what <span class="math">\(\bar 1\)</span> actually is: it's the set of all integers
that have <span class="math">\(1\)</span> as their remainder when divided by <span class="math">\(4\)</span>. So, <span class="math">\(5 \in \bar 1\)</span> for
example. What we've just done is define an addition operation on these <em>sets</em>
(as opposed to addition of integers). The operation works as follows. To add
<span class="math">\(\bar 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bar 3\)</span>, you do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take any number that has remainder <span class="math">\(2\)</span> (mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span>) and any number that has
   remainder <span class="math">\(3\)</span> (mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span>).</li>
<li>Add them together using normal integer addition and find the remainder (mod
   <span class="math">\(4\)</span>) of the result.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two important points here.</p>
<p>Firstly, we didn't need anything beyond what we had to come up with this
operation: it uses the addition operation that's <em>already defined</em> on the main
group to define an operation on the subsets.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is only well-defined if you always get the same answer regardless
of which integers you pick in step (1). In this case that is true.</p>
<p>So we have an example of a "quotient group": <span class="math">\(\{\bar 0, \bar 1, \bar 2, \bar
3\}\)</span> under this addition operation. Let's recap and start putting this in group
theoretic terminology.</p>
<h3 id="a-quotient-group-is-a-group-of-cosets">A quotient group is a group of cosets</h3>
<p><span class="math">\(\bar 0\)</span> (mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span>) is the following subset of the integers <span class="math">\(\Z\)</span> under addition:
<span class="math">\(\{\ldots, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, \ldots\}\)</span>. It's not only a subset, but a
<em>subgroup</em> (it contains the identity element <span class="math">\(0\)</span>, every element has an additive
inverse, and addition stays within the subset). It is written as <span class="math">\(4\Z\)</span> (or in
general, <span class="math">\(n\Z\)</span> for mod <span class="math">\(n\)</span>). However, we will often use <span class="math">\(H\)</span> for a subgroup, so
let's call it <span class="math">\(H\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\bar 1 = \{\ldots, -11, -7, -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, \ldots\}\)</span> is not a subgroup of
<span class="math">\(\Z\)</span> because it does not contain the identity element. What it is is a <em>coset</em>
of the subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span>: the set comprising all the results you get by adding <span class="math">\(1\)</span>
to elements of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>. We can write this as <span class="math">\(1 + H\)</span>. In fact, it's usually written
<span class="math">\(1H\)</span>; we just have to remember that the operation here is additive rather than
multiplicative.</p>
<p>Of course, <span class="math">\(\bar 2\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\bar 3\)</span> are cosets defined in the same way. <span class="math">\(\{\bar 0,
\bar 1, \bar 2, \bar 3\}\)</span> are the only distinct cosets: for example, <span class="math">\(\bar 4 =
4+H\)</span> is exactly the same set of integers as <span class="math">\(\bar 0\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math">\(5 + H = \bar
1\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p>So we arrived at the integers mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span> quotient group as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>We started with the group of integers under addition, <span class="math">\(\Z^+\)</span>.</li>
<li>We identified a subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span>.</li>
<li>We identified the cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\{H, 1+H, 2+H, 3+H\}\)</span></li>
<li>We defined an operation on the cosets: <span class="math">\((i+H) + (j+H) = (i+j)+H\)</span>.</li>
<li>We noted that it was only well-defined because
  <div class="math">$$
  \textstack{any number with}{remainder $i$} +
  \textstack{any number with}{remainder $j$} =
  \textstack{a number with the same}{remainder as $i+j$}.
  $$</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that (3) and (4) can equally be written like this, which is how it's
likely to be written write when considering subgroups and cosets more
abstractly:</p>
<p>(3). We identified the cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>: <span class="math">\(\{H, 1H, 2H, 3H\}\)</span></p>
<p>(4). We defined an operation on the cosets: <span class="math">\((iH) + (jH) = (ij)H\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="notational-digression">Notational digression</h3>
<p>The integers mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span> is written <span class="math">\(\Z/4\Z\)</span>. It's an example of a quotient
group. You read that as <span class="math">\((\text{some group}) / (\text{some subgroup})\)</span>. In this
case the group is the integers under addition, and the subgroup is <span class="math">\(4Z =
\{\ldots, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, \ldots\}\)</span><sup id="sf-quotient-groups-1-back"><a href="#sf-quotient-groups-1" class="simple-footnote" title="In this context, \(4\Z\) always means multiplication, even if the group operation is addition! So it's the set \(\{4z|z \in \Z\}\). It is not the same as the coset \(4 + \Z = \{4+z|z \in \Z\}\). This is a well-established notational inconsistency. ">1</a></sup>. In general,
one writes <span class="math">\(G/H\)</span> to refer to the quotient group of "<span class="math">\(G\)</span> mod <span class="math">\(H\)</span>".</p>
<h3 id="a-second-example-of-a-quotient-group">A second example of a quotient group</h3>
<p>Here's an example of a (simple) problem from an undergraduate textbook on group theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identify the quotient group <span class="math">\(\R^\times/P\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(P\)</span> denotes the subgroup of
positive real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does this mean and how does one do it? Well, let's try to follow the same
steps as for the integers mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span> example above.</p>
<p>Our starting group is the non-zero real numbers under multiplication <span class="math">\(\Rx\)</span>:
this plays the role of <span class="math">\(\Z^+\)</span> in the modular arithmetic example. And the
subgroup is the positive real numbers <span class="math">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>What are the cosets of <span class="math">\(P\)</span>? To get one example of a coset, you pick a number
<span class="math">\(x\)</span> from the main group, and you form a set by combining <span class="math">\(x\)</span> with each element
of the subgroup <span class="math">\(P\)</span> in turn. So that's the set <span class="math">\(\{xp|p \in P\}\)</span>. We can see
that we're either going to get all the positive reals (if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is positive), or
all the negative reals (if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is negative). So the set of cosets has those two
sets as its elements: <span class="math">\(\{P, -1P\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>OK, so we've done steps (1)-(3). Now, what's the group operation that's going
to combine two cosets and produce another coset? Well, in the integers mod <span class="math">\(4\)</span>
example, we used the standard addition of integers to define the result of
adding cosets <span class="math">\(i+H\)</span> and <span class="math">\(j+H\)</span> to be the coset <span class="math">\((i+j)+H\)</span>. The analogous
definition here would be to use the standard multiplication of real numbers to
say that <span class="math">\((xP)(yP) = (xy)P\)</span>. That's going to lead us to the following
intuitively reasonable multiplication table:</p>
<div class="math">$$
\begin{array}{ c|cc }
 ~   &amp; P   &amp; -1P \\
 \hline
 P   &amp; P   &amp; -1P \\
 -1P &amp; -1P &amp; P \\
\end{array}
$$</div>
<p>And we conclude that the quotient group is isomorphic to the group of size 2
(there's only one -- the one with this multiplication table).</p>
<p>The only question is (5): is the operation on cosets well-defined? In this
case, the answer is yes: for example, any positive number <span class="math">\(x \in P\)</span>, multiplied
by any negative number <span class="math">\(y \in -1P\)</span>, is going to give a negative number <span class="math">\(xy \in
-1P\)</span>.<sup id="sf-quotient-groups-2-back"><a href="#sf-quotient-groups-2" class="simple-footnote" title="We can prove it easily here because the group is commutative: \((xP)(yP) = (Px)(yP) = P(xy)P = (xy)PP = (xy)P\). In addition to commutativity those steps make use of associativity and closure.">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="quotient-groups-of-arbitrary-groups">Quotient groups of arbitrary groups</h3>
<p>What about in general? If we have a subgroup, can we just identify the cosets
of the subgroup, and define a composition law on them using the composition law
from the main group? Will it always be well-defined in the sense answered
above? The answer is: yes if and only if the subgroup is "normal".</p>
<p>A normal subgroup <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is defined to be a subgroup that is closed under
conjugation. This means that you can take any element <span class="math">\(g\)</span> of the main group,
form the product <span class="math">\(ghg^\1\)</span> using any element <span class="math">\(h\)</span> of the subgroup, and the result
will always be in the subgroup. One can prove that if and only if this is true,
then the composition of cosets is well-defined, in which case the prescription
above for forming a quotient group can be followed (find the cosets of <span class="math">\(H\)</span>,
define the operation on the cosets).</p>
<p>So, if you need to find a quotient group of some subgroup, you need to show
that the subgroup is normal. There are two ways of doing that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show that it is closed under conjugation.</li>
<li>Show that it is the kernel of a homomorphism.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is (2) interesting in that it could be <em>any</em> homomorphism? So if one can find
two different homomorphisms of which <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is the kernel, then...I guess one can
find many homomorphisms and the quotient group is isomorphic to their image
set, but they're all the same isomorphism class?</p>
