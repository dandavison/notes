For finite groups, the following words have basically the same meaning:
- bijective function
- permutation
-


Note that in the first two examples, the elements being composed are numbers or
matrices: they are not themselves functions. However, in $S_2$ and $S_3$, the
*elements* being composed are already function-like objects (a permutation of
$n$ objects is a bijection from the set to itself).

Hang on, is that true? Both multiplication by a complex number, and matrix
multiplication, can be viewed as composition of functions (a complex number
rotates and scales the complex plane, and a matrix is a linear transformation).
