*The kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.*

The structure-preserving property means that the element being conjugated
disappears leaving the conjugating elements to cancel each other out:

$$
\varphi(gag^{-1}) = \varphi(g)\varphi(a)\varphi(g^{-1}) = \varphi(g)1\varphi(g)^{-1} = 1
$$

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whether or not a map is a homomorphism, and what its kernel is, depend on what
the group operation in the codomain is. So you can find normal subgroups of a
group $G$ by considering codomains and codomain operations and determining
their kernel.

$A_n$ is a normal subgroup of $S_n$. What is $A_n$? OK it's to do with
permutations and permutation matrices. Read that bit of ch 1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For finite groups, the following words have basically the same meaning:
- bijective function
- permutation
-

Note that in the first two examples, the elements being composed are numbers or
matrices: they are not themselves functions. However, in $S_2$ and $S_3$, the
*elements* being composed are already function-like objects (a permutation of
$n$ objects is a bijection from the set to itself).

Hang on, is that true? Both multiplication by a complex number, and matrix
multiplication, can be viewed as composition of functions (a complex number
rotates and scales the complex plane, and a matrix is a linear transformation).
